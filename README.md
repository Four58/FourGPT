## This is FourGPT

I just wanted to write some nextjs and I think that maybe creating a nextjs project with chatGPT api would be fun. Nevertheless, I don't know how far I will go since I still have other project to work on :/

These are the features it can do right now:

- Q&A like chatgpt 3.5
- Generate a code with great UXUI highlighted on the code.

Todo:

- add picture prompt
- store q&a history
- add authentication
